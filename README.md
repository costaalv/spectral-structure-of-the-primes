# The Spectral Structure of Prime Numbers
**The Zeros Do Not Create — They Record**

[Clique aqui para ler este README em português](README_pt.md)

## Overview

This repository contains all notebooks, scripts, and data used in the article:
**“The Zeros Do Not Create — They Record: The Spectral Structure of the Primes”**

The central idea is simple and powerful:
> The non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function do not cause the structure of the primes — they record it.

The entire spectral structure of the primes is already encoded in $\pi(x)$ and its logarithmic energy.
The zeta zeros merely reflect this hidden arithmetic organization.

## Key Results

- The function $F_E(x)$ records internal oscillations in the structure of the primes.
- A Hermitian matrix built from $F_E(x)$ reproduces the zeta zeros with extreme precision.
- The Riemann zeros **naturally emerge** as eigenvalues of this matrix.
- The prime structure is compatible with an underlying quantum spectral system.

## Mathematical Play

To celebrate and communicate the findings, we’ve also created a theatrical piece:

**“15 Mathematical Scenes to Uncover the Prime Number Mystery”**

The play stages a fictional dialogue between great minds — Gauss, Riemann, Dirichlet, Schrödinger — around the spectral structure of prime numbers.

It is rigorous, provocative, and playful, designed to bridge deep mathematics and a broader audience.

## Reproducibility

All notebooks are sequentially numbered.

To reproduce the results:

1. Open the `.ipynb` files in Jupyter Notebook or VSCode.
2. Run cell by cell.
3. Check the graphs and the comparisons between estimated and real zeros.

## Acknowledgments

Inspired by Gauss, Riemann, Schrödinger, and the belief that primes are not chaos — they are discrete music.
